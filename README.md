# Feed Folks
Feed Folks is a community-centered food equity hub for folks to connect with one another, disseminate resources for ways to access free/affordable produce/meals, and translate media to ensure events are equitable.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind

As we navigate existence under the current presidency, Feed Folks aims to be a space where resource access transcends barriers. While various social media platforms exist, not every organization or resource is posted in every forum and people of different identities may not participate in the same spaces.

In addition to features such as joining groups for specific topics and directly messaging people, a characteristic of Feed Folks Iâ€™m excited to enhance is its translation feature. Growing up, I was often the bridge between my family and resources offered; directly experiencing how language can be an immense barrier from obtaining supplies for survival motivated me to implement this into Feed Folks, especially when thinking about the intergenerational gaps that exist between older non-English speaking folks.

This application is still growing


## Future Optimizations
- Refactor Tailwind CSS
- Implement more graphics and interactive elements
- Integrate non-AI translator API
- Create pods for people to engage in different conversations online
